# Programming-Assignment-2
This is a repo for Week 3 of R Programming in Coursera

In this repo, I make a function which enables me to solve the value of an inverse matrix and stored it in the cache.
If the original value of the matrix remains the same, the second function is able to recall the value of the inverse matrix directly from cache.
